# Deep Learning Challenge - Alphabet Soup
## Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Overview
Explain purpose of analysis

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    * Target Variable
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    * Features
* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    * Variables to remove from input data

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
